This is because some have certain restrictions at point of sale. Below is the data that is guranteed to be available across all of our partners. Merchant email - merchant's email address logo_url - a URL to the image of their logo seen on the home screen name - merchant's display name round_start - a timestamp of when the latest round has started total_allowance_spent - total allowance spent since the round has begun merchant_uid - a unique id for the merchant Sale Every merchant has a collection of sales completed_at - a timestamp of when the sale was completed id - a unique id for the sale initiated_at - a timestamp of when the sale was initiated (when the merchant has input the price) merchant_id - the merchant's unique id merchant_name - the merchant's display name paid_with_credit - the amount covered by allowance. ( total_price - actual_amount_user_paid ) status - The status of the sale ( \"complete\" , \"pending\" , or \"aborted\" ) user_id - The unique id of the user Additional data The following data is available for all of our merchants except for GT Vapes Merchant total_community_spend - The total USD spent by our customers since the round has begun Sale paid_with_cash - the amount of money the user has spent at point of sale total_price - the full price of the sale Stores which use Allowance All stores except for Georgetown Gourmet also have data regarding the user's balance.
